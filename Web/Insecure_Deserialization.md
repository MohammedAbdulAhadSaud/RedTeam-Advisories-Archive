# Insecure Deserialization

**Category:** Insecure Deserialization  
**Severity:** High or Critical

## Definition

**Insecure Deserialization** occurs when an application takes serialized data from an untrusted source and deserializes it without properly validating or controlling what is being processed.

**Serialization** is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted. **Deserialization** is the reverse process, where that data is converted back into an object that the application can use.

The vulnerability appears when the application **trusts serialized data that can be modified by an attacker**.

In simple terms:

```text
Object
   |
   | Serialization
   v
Serialized Data
   |
   | Sent to / stored by application
   v
Attacker modifies the data
   |
   | Deserialization
   v
Application reconstructs the object
